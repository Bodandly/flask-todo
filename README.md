### Learning Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should understand:

* Simple database usage
* Testing Flask applications

## Details

### Deliverables

* A Git repo called flask-todo containing at least:
  * `README.md` file explaining how to run your project
  * a `requirements.txt` file
  * a suite of tests for your project

### Requirements  

* Passing unit tests
* No PEP8 or Pyflakes warnings or errors

## Normal Mode

Use Flask to create a simple todo list that looks similar to the
following:

![wireframe](todo.png)

You will need to handle three situations:

* Showing the main todo list
* Submitting a new todo
* Deleting checked todos

The new todo form and current todos form should be separate HTML forms.

Your application should be tested.

## Hard Mode

In addition to the requirements from **Normal Mode**:

* Add in a way to edit current todos.
* Change the behavior from deleting checked todos to marking them as done and removing them from the page. Then add a new page to show completed todos.
